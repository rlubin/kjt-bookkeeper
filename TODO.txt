put basic instructions onto interface and simply put a process button

how to i want to process the files?
    probably smash everything into 2 separate pandas dataframes
        check the account number, based on the account number analyze in a different way
        getting an error when putting into df, so i must first go through it via csv save into dictionary then create a df
    smash each one into its own dataframe
    separate them based on account number (first line of file)
    i care about date, description, amount (amounts can be positive(deposited) or negative(withdrawn))

i want to split them up into categories
and display totals of categories etc
